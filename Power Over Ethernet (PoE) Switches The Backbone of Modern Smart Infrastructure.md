# Power Over Ethernet (PoE) Switches: The Backbone of Modern Smart Infrastructure

As the demand for intelligent, connected systems continues to grow across industries, PoE (Power over Ethernet) switches are emerging as indispensable tools in powering and networking devices simultaneously. By combining data and power over a single Ethernet cable, PoE switches reduce installation complexity, lower costs, and enable highly scalable deploymentsâ€”especially in environments where running separate electrical lines is difficult or cost-prohibitive.

PoE switches are being widely deployed in surveillance systems, automation networks, smart buildings, industrial applications, and public infrastructure projects. Their flexibility, power delivery capabilities, and support for edge computing devices make them central to the advancement of digital transformation.
